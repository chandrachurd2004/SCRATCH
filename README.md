About the Field

We are facing global warning the heat wave are increasing , the ice are melting in polar region.


Problems Nowadays

In past human history industrial revolution had beguin in all the capital nation like USA , Britain , france etc. With the growth of this industry the need for eneargy also increased. Due to the lack of techonology and finances the cheap source of eneargy was the thermal eneargy. Without thinking of the future concequenses the implemented this thermal eneary in mass. Due to this the other country also started using thermal eneargy to meet their eneargy demands.As mass adption of the thermal eneargy the demand of coal grew , which is a positive sign , but the coal waste product also grew ans the smoke which was generated while burning coal was mixing with atmosphere. This caused global warming / green house effect. This carbon-di-oxide didn't allow heat to excape from earth and due to this future generation we are facing the concequences.


Solution

According to me now we have techonology and finances , so we should build a techonology to save our evoirment , us and our future generation. I thing we arepretty much succesfull in that like we have build solar eneargy , nuclear eneargy etc
It is a fact that in one hour earth recieves as much sun's radition that can meet our eneargy need of one year. So , if we capture all the sun's eneargy (which is not economical feasiable) we will be free for atleast one year.
There are other sources of eneargy as well like wind eneargy , hydro-electricty , neuclear eneargy , tidal eneargy ,etc 
Now implimenting all the new age techonology has it own economical and finincial chalanges, like making solar panel to cover all over the earth for just onehour is not economically and finincially possible.
So, a best alternative can be making eneargy by combination of all this new age eneargy source , like whenever space is there make nuclear power plant , andif public support is there to make a dam , in desert areas if feasiable make solar plant.
